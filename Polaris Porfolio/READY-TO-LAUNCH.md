## 💬 Your Story, Your Words

> "Polaris started off as the team destined for failure. We began our year with 0 sponsors, $0 of funding, and no clear idea of where to go, who was on the team, and how we would improve."

> "Yet, we persevered. When we started off the year with a bot held together by zipties and cardboard, it seemed like we were already a team worth giving up on. But somehow we managed to score, and we kept scoring, and getting better and better every single game."

> "Polaris taught our team how to connect, conflict, and build upon one another, leading to what might be the most improved team in all of FTC."

**This story is now beautifully presented in your portfolio! 🏆**
