# 🌟 Judge Mode & Presentation Features Guide

## 🎯 What is Judge Mode?

**Judge Mode is a special feature that automatically highlights ALL your key innovations, achievements, and important information** when presenting to judges.

## 🎯 Why Each Feature Exists

### 1. Judge Mode Highlights Important Info
**Problem:** Judges see 20+ teams. Important details get lost.
**Solution:** Automatic highlighting makes your achievements impossible to miss.

### 2. Full Section Visibility
**Problem:** Headers covered top of sections, making them hard to read.
**Solution:** Sections now scroll to perfect position with header offset (80px).

### 3. Section Indicator
**Problem:** Judges didn't know where they were in presentation.
**Solution:** Always-visible indicator shows current section.

### 4. Keyboard Shortcuts
**Problem:** Clicking buttons during presentation looks unprofessional.
**Solution:** Seamless navigation with Space/Arrow keys.

### 5. Notifications
**Problem:** Actions happened silently—users didn't know what changed.
**Solution:** Visual feedback for every action.
